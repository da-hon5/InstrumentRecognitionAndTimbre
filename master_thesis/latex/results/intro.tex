In this chapter, results of various experiments, conducted in the context of this work, are presented. Different transfer learning approaches for the classifier and the timbre estimators are investigated. Moreover, experiments using several mixing strategies and classification thresholds for the classifier are conducted. Finally, the performance of all models is reported, which is not a trivial task for the timbre estimators.
