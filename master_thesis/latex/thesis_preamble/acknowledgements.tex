First of all, I would like to thank sonible GmbH for giving me the opportunity to work on this exciting project. I could not have undertaken this journey without you. Although I was totally inexperienced in deep learning, the topic you proposed fascinated me from the beginning. In particular, I'm grateful to Markus Huber for spending many hours with me discussing problems and guiding me through the project.\\

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Franz Pernkopf for supervising this thesis. His great expertise in machine learning was invaluable whenever I was stuck with a problem.\\

Furthermore, I want to thank my parents for financing my study time and for their support in everything I do. I always took that for granted, but it is not. I'm just starting to realize how much they did for me in the past 30 years.\\

Special thanks should also go to my girlfriend for her patience when I worked long hours, for proof-reading the whole thesis and for everything else she does for me.
