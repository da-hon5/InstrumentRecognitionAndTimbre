\openingquote{They misunderestimated me.}{Guess Who}

The template does not provide too many ``stylish'' commands. One of them created the quote above, the others are intended to mark a part of the text using the margins. You can, for example

\bigskip\bigskip
\dots state that this is dangerous.\MDanger

\bigskip\bigskip
\dots tell the reader to ``better pay attention''.\MAttention

\bigskip\bigskip
\dots mark some central results.\MHint

\bigskip\bigskip
\dots also admit that you're just clueless.\MQuestion
